## Pick tutorial quality signals

Choose videos that show wallet confirmations clearly and mention risks.

## Rehearse with tiny value

Before larger transfers, do one tiny transaction and verify confirmation in an explorer.

## Keep your own checklist

Your learning speed improves when you document each action in your own words.
