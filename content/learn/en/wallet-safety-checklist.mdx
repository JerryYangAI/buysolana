## Separate wallets by purpose

Use one wallet for testing and one for long-term storage. This lowers risk when you try new apps.

## Protect seed phrases

Store backup phrases offline in at least two safe locations. Do not keep them in screenshots or cloud notes.

## Confirm before signing

Check recipient address, token amount, and network before every signature.
