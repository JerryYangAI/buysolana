## Why docs first

Official docs are useful when you read them in the right sequence. Beginners usually jump into advanced pages too early.

## Suggested reading order

1. Accounts and programs
2. Transactions and fees
3. RPC and explorers
4. Tooling and frameworks

## How to take notes

Write one short note for each page:
- What problem this concept solves
- One real action you can do next
- One risk to avoid
